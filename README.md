# Stoch.-rocess-and-Opt.-Control-Final-Project

Urban traffic and its increasing, have always been part of the discussed issues; Because traffic causes problems such as air pollution, congestion in cities, and increasing commuting time for people in society, and its increase increases the importance of dealing with this issue. One of the proposed solutions for this issue is the use of smart transportation; A solution that has become an efficient and practical lever in both academic research and industry to solve this problem. The main goal in this type of research is to increase the security and the safety factor of the privacy of each of these vehicles, and overcoming each of these cases is one of the major challenges of this issue. In the design of this type of intelligent systems, the part related to sensors, the network between components and communications play a very important role; Because usually the control center of these systems is located somewhere far away from the main system and using the information that is received from the sensors of the system and then transmitted, the control signal, after calculation in the control center, reaches the system and is applied to it. It can be But as it is clear from the title of the reviewed article [1], during the transfer of information from the sensors to the control center, sabotage operations are performed on the transmitted data. In this regard, in the continuation of the report, first the modeling of the system state space will be discussed, and then by simulating a cyber attack, the variables of the system states will be estimated from the received contaminated information, and after designing the appropriate controller, the values related to each of The system states will converge to zero. In the last part of the report, the investigation and simulation of methods based on reinforcement learning to solve the problem of linear quadratic regulation for discrete time random systems and to obtain the optimal control policy will be discussed.
